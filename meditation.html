        Mindful Mealtime Media is a meditative cooking podcast with an emphasis
        on noticing sensations and celebrating mistakes. We planned to meet
        students' needs by providing bi-monthly grocery lists and recipes via
        text, e-mail, or physical mail service.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is a podcast that was distributed across multiple online channels
        including Spotify, Youtube, and our speical website. Listeners can find
        community, share insights, and enjoy immersive play-mode to enrich their
        mindful cooking experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        This project was created for a 14 week course, ARTG3463: Experience
        Design 2, at Northeastern University with the objective of creating
        compelling human-centered experiences.

      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>
        We kicked off our primary research by narrowing down the problem space
        that we wanted to explore and defining our goals for primary research.
        We each brainstormed ideas for questions to ask to our sample audience
        to learn more about their:
      </p>
      <div id="grid" style="margin-top: 10px">
        <div id="left">
          <li>cooking process</li>
          <li>cooking support</li>
          <li>eating experiences</li>
          <li>meal inspiration</li>
          <li>ideal meal experience</li>
        </div>
        <div id="right">
          <li>grocery shopping experience</li>
          <li>priorities in a meal experience</li>
          <li>pain points/barriers to enjoyable meal preparation</li>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        A sample size of 15 college students responsed to the survey we
        released. From these results, my group learned that the information we
        were more interested in learning was much more personal, qualitative,
        and emotional. We thought that an in-depth interview or cultural probes
        would be a better fit for what we were looking for because we wanted
        understand the “why” behind students' cooking experiences and other
        alternatives students utilize other than cooking. With these findings,
        my group decided to shift our project focus:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20px">
        <b>Focus:</b> We want to make the meal preparation experience easier for
        young individuals just starting to fend for themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        <b>Actors:</b> 18-24 year olds with limited cooking experience
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        <b>Action:</b> Preparing meals - includes finding meal inspiration,
        grocery shopping, planning, cooking, nourishing your body
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        <b>Context:</b> Being new to cooking, little experience, first time
        having to cook for themselves
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
    </div>

    <br />
    <h1>Cultural Probes</h1>
    <p>
      We understood that cooking is a very personal and emotional experience,
      intrinsically tied to a person's background, taste, skill-level,
      energy-level, or daily mood. In order to truly understand students'
      experiences, we thought it best to capture a snapshot into their lives by
      conducting interesting visual cultural probes. To determine which cultural
      probes would be the most impactful for gathering the type of data we
      wanted, we decided to test our methods on ourselves first.
    </p>

    <h2>Method 1: Meal Log</h2>
    <p>
      Description: Photo journal your meal prep experience for the week by
      taking candid photos of the food you eat, reflecting on the process, and
      your emotions surrounding your meals.
    </p>
    <img src="images/meditation/meal log.png" class="center" width="60%" />

    <h2>Method 2: Three Scenarios</h2>
    <p>Draw the following three meal preparation scenarios:</p>
    <ol class="meditation-ul">
      <li class="meditation-li">Typical weekday meal experience</li>
      <li class="meditation-li">Ideal weekday meal experience</li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        Ideal weekend or dream meal experience when you have all the time and
        resources you could need
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>What do you feel, think, and do in these three scenarios?</p>
    <img src="images/meditation/3 scenarios.png" class="center" width="40%" />

    <h2>Method 3: Love + Breakup Letter</h2>
    <p>
      Write a love and breakup letter to two different aspects of your meal
      preparation lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, you can choose to serenade your favorite dish or say goodbye
      to an old habit.
    </p>
    <img src="images/meditation/love-breakup letter.png" class="center" />

    <h2>Cultural Probe Takeaways</h2>
    <p>We came to a conclusion that the meal log activity was:</p>
    <ul class="meditation-ul">
      <li class="meditation-li">
        time-consuming and difficult to do throughout the week
      </li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        needed to be shortened down into a retrospective rather than a
        journaling probe.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px">
      The Three Scenarios and Love Letter probes helped us gain perspective on
      our experience, and talking through these while illustrating would greatly
      help going forward. We planned to use these probes during interviews and
      ask the respondents to chat with us while drawing their
      current/ideal/dream meal experience.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />

    <div class="background-container">
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>Interviews</h1>
      <p>
        We conducted eight in-depth interviews and collected the three cultural
        probes with our target sample audience of college students, then
        visualized the data on personal cardsets. Below is an example of a
        personal cardset.
      </p>
      <img src="images/meditation/interview.png" width="60%" class="center" />
      <h2>Interview Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        After conducting eight in-depth interviews and collecting cultural
        probes with our target sample audience of college students, we
        synthesized the findings to these main takeaways:
      </p>
      <div class="interview-takeaways">

          <img

      <br />
      <br />
    </div>

    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>Personas</h1>
    <p>
      Using our main takeaways as guidance, each member of the team brainstormed
      one persona that represents the current experience, painpoints, goals, and
      wants of our audience. Then as a team, we synthesized all our individual
      personas and condensed them into two personas that represented the three
      main problems our audience experiences:
    </p>
    <ul class="meditation-ul">
      <li>lack of cooking skills</li>
      <li>lack of inspiration</li>
      <li>lack of time</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="persona">

        />
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Journey Maps</h2>
    <p>
      Based on these 2 personas (Luke and Jane), we created 2 journey maps to
      that reflects their motivations and painpoints, measured emotions through
      color and timeline.

      <h1>Design Proposal</h1>
      <p>
        Using our personas, journey maps and user stories representing main pain
        points and wants as inspiration, we developed our design requirements to
        represent what criteria our design must meet in order to be useful for
        the audience.

      <p style="margin-top: 10px">
        At this point, we had identified experiential goals and metrics, and had
        gathered enough information to understand our target audiences, we began
        to generate ideas through ideation and develop our design concept.
        During this creative process of generating, developing, and
        communicating new ideas, we brainstormed 25 possible solutions to the
        design problem disregarding any feasibility restrictions or constraints.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/meditation/design proposal examples.png"
        width="40%"
        class="center"
      />

      <p>
        We then each voted on our top 3 concepts by evaluating all the ideation
        concepts against the design requirements. We then consolidated these
        ideas into a final 3 ideas: a community recipe annotating app, a
        collaborative kitchen, and an AI kitchen.
      </p>
      <ul class="meditation-ul">
        <li class="meditation-li">
          The collaborative kitchen is an idea for a community kitchen that
          would function as a playground for young people to come together and
          exploring cooking.

        <li class="meditation-li">
          AI kitchen is a screen with virtual assistant AI technology that is
          designed for apartments and shared kitchens.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        We decided on our final idea by thinking about which solution solved the
        most user needs and fit the most design requirements. We decided on a
        Cooking Buddy Competition App.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Concept</h2>
      <p>
        The group devoted 10 minutes to sketching possible iterations for the
        primary concept, the cooking buddy competition app. The primary
        functions we tried to answer were:
      </p>
      <ol class="meditation-ul">
        <li class="meditation-li">
          How should the daily support, functional side of the app look? work?
        </li>
        <li class="meditation-li">
          What is a fun, visual way to incentivize users so they see their

        with his two roommates. Luke's roommates often cook food for him, which
        is his motivation to learn how to cook. While scrolling through his
        phone, he finds an app that has a cooking community, resouces, and
        recipes for various dishes. Luke gives it a try and makes his first dish
        for his roommates. A few days later, Luke gets a notification to
        participate in a weekly cooking challenge. He decides to ask his
        roommates to join this weekly cooking challenge and in the end, they all
        have fun learning a new dish and enjoying their food.

    <h1>Cookingbuds Trial</h1>
    <p>
      Thanks to this virtual semester, we had the inspiration to test out our
      idea for a trial run through a Zoom call. We decided to make 10 minute
      oven-baked tostadas. We followed the recipe by Kristen Maxwell posted on
      <a href="yellowblissroad.com"> yellowblissroad.com</a>. Before we all met
      up in a virtual meeting room to cook, each person prepared their
      ingredients (in their own way) for the dish. During the Zoom call, we
      looked through the writing recipe, watched a video tutorial, tried to cook
      along with each other, and chatted. In the end, everyone made their dish
      in their own unique way.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>We had some helpful and interesting takeaways after our trial:</p>

    <ul class="meditation-ul">
      <li class="meditation-li">
        <b>Not everyone followed the directions of the recipe and improvised</b>
        as they continued cooking ie. using different ingredients or
        substituting for ingredients that they didn't have.
      </li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        <b>Different prefrences:</b> Some prefered making their own salsa/guac
        instead of buying it from the store, which resulted in a longer cooking
        time.
      </li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        <b>People worked at different paces:</b> not everyone needed 10 minutes
        to cook or they needed more than 10 minutes to cook.
      </li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        <b>Background activity/noise</b> made the experience distracting and
        listening to everyone talk on the Zoom call while trying to focus on
        cooking was overstimulating.
      </li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        <b>The video chat feature made focusing on cooking a challenge</b>
        because not everyone checks the chat.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Takeaways from CookingBuds</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Before CookingBuds:</b> Anxiety about preparedness, lack of time, and
      excitement about new recipe
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>During CookingBuds:</b> Anxiety about pace of cooking, lack of
      stability/organization, difference in customization, and need to multitask
      such as cooking, video chatting, roommates, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>After CookingBuds:</b> Enjoyment of socialization, felt impactful, some
      discomfort eating in front of each other Everyone mapped out their
      experience of what happened before, during, and after the CookingBuds
      trial.

      <h1>Refocusing the Design</h1>
      <p>
        At this point, we presented our design proposal to the class. We took
        feedback from critique of our design proposal. We realized that this
        concept was not the correct solution. Building functional skills did not
        improve the cooking experience as much as we had hoped. Thus, we pivoted
        our ideas and changed our design goal to building and improving
        confidence in our audiences.
      </p>

      <h2>Problem Pivot</h2>
      <p><b>What people understood our problem statement to be:</b></p>
      <ul class="meditation-ul">
        <li class="meditation-li">
          Students not having enough time, inspiration, or cooking skills to
          properly cook for themselves
        </li>
        <li class="meditation-li">Lack of inspiration for cooking</li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <p><b>Significance of our problem:</b></p>
      <p>
        One student agreed that this is a significant problem: cooking does get
        boring and she makes the same thing every night. She would want this
        solution if it was easy to use Another student said that he needs our
        solution, but wouldn't actually use it. His ideal self would use it, but
        not in reality.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p><b>The main problem:</b></p>
      <p>
        Students' confidence in their cooking, not inspiration for cooking. For
        example, not knowing what to do, lack of confidence in skills and
        abilities, feeling intimidated by the time and skills required to cook
      </p>
      <br />

      <p><b>New Design Criteria:</b></p>
      <div id="grid">
        <div id="left">
          Quick and Easy:
          <li>

          <li>not cooking alone</li>
        </div>
      </div>

            all levels, you're going to be taught so everyone can join)
          </li>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />

      <p style="margin-top: 10px">
        Instead of focusing on the functional aspect of cooking, like improving
        peoples' cooking skills and confidence through teaching, we wanted to
        'meet people on where they are at'. We developed a plan to focus on the
        the emotional side of cooking to help people feel more comfortable and
        relaxed. Since students will have to cook anyways, their stress can be
        reduced and their lives can be improved by turning cooking into an
        enjoyable and relaxing experience. We believed this enjoyment of cooking
        to be a more impactful problem to tackle than improving in cooking
        skill.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p><b>We refined our problem statement:</b></p>
      <p>
        Cooking is one of many overwhelming responsibilities college students
        face and it adds to their stress. In the midst of stress, students are
        seeking a time to relax and reflect.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        College students often feel constrained and stressed with unpredictable
        schedules. Even meeting necessary everyday needs such as getting meals
        becomes overwhelming or mundane. In face of that stress, we believe that
        cooking could become a new source of relaxation.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p><b>Design Hypothesis:</b></p>
      <p>
        If we transform cooking into a mindful and enjoyable experience instead
        of it being a mundane responsibility, then cooking can become a mental
        therapy tool to destress college students.
      </p>
      <br />
    </div>

    <h1>Precedents</h1>
    <p>
      There are many factors that make college students feel overwhelmed. If we
      made a product that delivers comfort and more resilience towards meal
      prep, it could make students feel more at peace about one aspect of their
      lives (which leads students to feel more stable and okay with unknowns and
      new challenges).
      <b
        >Our new goal for the project was to make cooking into a comforting and
        relaxing experience in the face of stressful student life.</b
      >
      We also wanted to keep in mind that we wanted cooking to be supported and
      people can be playful with it.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      For researching precedents, we brainstormed ideas on what models would
      address students' feelings that overwhelm them and how we can offer
      comfort to the meal prep experience. We researched some product
      competitors (services and products that help people feel comfortable with
      cooking) such as meal prep kit services, recipe apps/blogs and the air
      fryer. We also researched other methods of relaxation like exercise
      classes, baking, and kitchen management.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>Precedent takeaways</h2>
    <p>
      From our precedents research, we learned that we should incorporate the
      following into our concept:
    </p>
    <div id="grid" style="margin-top: 10px">
      <div id="left">
        <li>Add encouragement + rewards</li>
        <li>Facilitate a sense of community</li>
        <li>Give users a place to be themselves</li>
        <li>Allot time for cooking + socializing</li>
        <li>Allow users to schedule time to relax in advance</li>
        <li>Show users how cooking/relaxing can be productive</li>
      </div>
      <div id="right">
        <li>
          Incorporate a way to track + reflect on feelings of success and
          completion
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an activity that helps users be fully present by focusing on an
          immersive task
        </li>
        <li>Incorporate mindfulness + making a conscious choice to unwind</li>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Experiment</h1>
    <p>
      We developed a prototype of a six-minute relaxing, mindfulness cooking
      podcast and potential Spotify interface visuals for our podcast. Then, our
      team recruited a total of 5 students (3 NEU / 2 non-NEU) to listen and
      answer some questions about our podcast to gather some feedback on if this
      design concept was successful in relaxing students.
    </p>
    <img src="images/meditation/experiment.png" class="center" width="55%" />
    <br />

    <p>Key takeaways from the experiment:</p>
    <ul class="meditation-ul">
      <li class="meditation-li">Emphasis on immersive audio experience</li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        Need for flexibility and interaction with podcast itself
      </li>
      <li class="meditation-li">Need to consider length of podcast</li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        Interest in different personalities showcased
      </li>
      <li class="meditation-li">Priority for individual meditation</li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        Priority for calming visuals, option for video

      <h1>Wireframing</h1>
      <p>
        In Week 12, we created low-fidelity wireframes for primary interfaces
        and produced sample content to emulate the intended experience. To
        complement our prototypes, we produced storyboards to illustrate our
        service in action.
      </p>
      <img src="images/meditation/prototype.png" width="60%" class="center" />

      <p style="margin-top: 10px">
        We drafted a preliminary prototype to further gauge the user's opinions
        and experiences. In particular, the testing comprised of:
      </p>
      <ul class="meditation-ul">
        <li class="meditation-li">
          3-minute smoothie podcast to highlight a different personality or

        <li class="meditation-li">
          low-fidelity wireframes of offered media -- mobile, desktop, spotify,
          youtube

      <ul class="meditation-ul">
        <li class="meditation-li">
          <b>We incorporated environmental ASMR sounds</b>
          (like the sounds of sizzling and chopping) into the podcast audio to
          make it a more relaxing and immersive experience that encourages
          listeners to tune into their senses.
        </li>
        <li class="meditation-li">
          <b>We added relaxing jazz music</b> to the intro and outro to set a
          mindful mood.
        </li>
        <li class="meditation-li">
          <b>We used calming language</b> throughout with a mindful and playful
          tone that reminds audiences to rest and treat themselves with care.
        </li>
        <li class="meditation-li">
          <b>Meditation sessions / breathing exercises are incorporated</b>
          throughout the longer podcasts with more of an emphasis on meditation.
