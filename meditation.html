        <div>Mindful Mealtime Media is a meditative cooking podcast with an emphasis
        on noticing sensations and celebrating mistakes. We planned to meet
        students' needs by providing bi-monthly grocery lists and recipes via
        text, e-mail, or physical mail service.</div>
        <br>
        <div>There is a podcast that was distributed across multiple online channels
        including Spotify, Youtube, and our speical website. Listeners can find
        community, share insights, and enjoy immersive play-mode to enrich their
        mindful cooking experience.</div>
        <br>
        <div>This project was created for a 14 week course, ARTG3463: Experience
        Design 2, at Northeastern University with the objective of creating

    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
      We kicked off our primary research by narrowing down the problem space
      that we wanted to explore and defining our goals for primary research. We
      each brainstormed ideas for questions to ask to our sample audience to
      learn more about their cooking process, cooking support, eating
      experiences, meal inspiration, ideal meal experience, grocery shopping
      experience, priorities in a meal experience, and pain points/barriers to
      enjoyable meal preparation.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <b>Focus:</b> We want to make the meal preparation experience easier for
      young individuals just starting to fend for themselves.
    </p>
    <p><b>Actors:</b> 18-24 year olds with limited cooking experience</p>
    <p>
      <b>Action:</b> Preparing meals - includes finding meal inspiration,
      grocery shopping, planning, cooking, nourishing your body
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Context:</b> Being new to cooking, little experience, first time having
      to cook for themselves
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <h1>Cultural Probes</h1>
    <p>
      We understood that cooking is a very personal and emotional experience,
      intrinsically tied to a person's background, taste, skill-level,
      energy-level, or daily mood. In order to truly understand students'
      experiences, we thought it best to capture a snapshot into their lives by
      conducting interesting visual cultural probes.

    <h1>Interviews</h1>
    <p>
      We conducted eight in-depth interviews and collected the three cultural
      probes with our target sample audience of college students, then
      visualized the data on personal cardsets. Below is an example of a
      personal cardset.
    </p>

    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <h1>Personas</h1>
    <p>
      Using our main takeaways as guidance, each member of the team brainstormed
      one persona that represents the current experience, painpoints, goals, and
      wants of our audience. Then as a team, we synthesized all our individual
      personas and condensed them into two personas that represented the three
      main problems our audience experiences:
      <b>lack of cooking skills, inspiration, and time</b>
    </p>
    <div class="journey-map-img">
      <img
        src="images/meditation/persona luke.png"
        class="center"
      />
    </div>
    <br />

    <h2>Journey Maps</h2>
    <p>
      Based on these our persona, Luke, we created a journey map to that
      reflects his motivations and painpoints, measured emotions through color
      and timeline.
    </p>
    <div>
      <img
        src="images/meditation/luke journey map.png"
        class="center"
      />
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <h1>Design Proposal</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      Using our personas, journey maps and user stories representing main pain
      points and wants as inspiration, we developed our design requirements to
      represent what criteria our design must meet in order to be useful for the
      audience.
    </p>

    <div id="grid" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 220px">
        <li>Quick & Easy</li>
        <li>Social Connection</li>
        <li>Low Cost</li>
        <li>Comfort & Familiarity</li>
        <li>Flexibility/Versatility</li>
        <li>Learning Community</li>
        <li>Meal Ideas & Cooking Techniques</li>
        <li>Learning Cooking Skills</li>
        <li>Grocery Planning</li>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top: 10px">
      At this point, we had identified experiential goals and metrics, and had
      gathered enough information to understand our target audiences, we began
      to generate ideas through ideation and develop our design concept. We
      decided on our final idea by thinking about which solution solved the most
      user needs and fit the most design requirements. We decided on a
      <b>Cooking Buddy Competition Application</b>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <h1>Storyboard</h1>
    <p>
      We created storyboards to visualize how the users would interact with our
      product. Our storyboard follows the journey of Luke, a college student who
      lives with his two roommates. Luke's roommates often cook food for him,
      which is his motivation to learn how to cook. While scrolling through his
      phone, he finds an app that has a cooking community, resouces, and recipes
      for various dishes. Luke gives it a try and makes his first dish for his
      roommates. A few days later, Luke gets a notification to participate in a
      weekly cooking challenge. He decides to ask his roommates to join this
      weekly cooking challenge and in the end, they all have fun learning a new
      dish and enjoying their food.

    <h2>Cookingbuds Trial & Takeaways</h2>
    <p>We had some helpful and interesting takeaways after our trial:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Not everyone followed the directions of the recipe and improvised</b>
        as they continued cooking ie. using different ingredients or
        substituting for ingredients that they didn't have.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Different prefrences:</b> Some prefered making their own salsa/guac
        instead of buying it from the store, which resulted in a longer cooking
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>People worked at different paces:</b> not everyone needed 10 minutes
        to cook or they needed more than 10 minutes to cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Background activity/noise</b> made the experience distracting and
        listening to everyone talk on the Zoom call while trying to focus on
        cooking was overstimulating.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>The video chat feature made focusing on cooking a challenge</b>
        because not everyone checks the chat.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img
      src="images/meditation/cookingbuds trial.png"
      class="center"
    />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <h1>Refocusing the Design</h1>

    <p><b>Problem Pivot</b></p>
    <p>
      Building functional skills did not improve the cooking experience as much
      as we had hoped. Thus, we pivoted our ideas and changed our design goal to
      building and improving confidence in our audiences. For example, not
      knowing what to do, lack of confidence in skills and abilities, feeling
      intimidated by the time and skills required to cook
    </p>
    <br />

    <p><b>We refined our problem statement:</b></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      Cooking is one of many overwhelming responsibilities college students face
      and it adds to their stress. In the midst of stress, students are seeking
      a time to relax and reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      College students often feel constrained and stressed with unpredictable
      schedules. Even meeting necessary everyday needs such as getting meals
      becomes overwhelming or mundane. In face of that stress, we believe that
      cooking could become a new source of relaxation.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p><b>Design Hypothesis:</b></p>
    <p>
      If we transform cooking into a mindful and enjoyable experience instead of
      it being a mundane responsibility, then cooking can become a mental
      therapy tool to destress college students.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <h1>Experiment</h1>
    <p>
      We developed a prototype of a six-minute relaxing, mindfulness cooking
      podcast and potential Spotify interface visuals for our podcast. Then, our
      team recruited a total of 5 students (3 NEU / 2 non-NEU) to listen and
      answer some questions about our podcast to gather some feedback on if this
      design concept was successful in relaxing students.
    </p>
    <img src="images/meditation/experiment.png" class="center" />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <div class="background-container">
      <br />
      <h1>Storyboard</h1>
      <p>
        To complement our prototypes, we produced storyboards to illustrate our
        service in action. Following testing feedback into our storyboard:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>We incorporated environmental ASMR sounds</b>
          (like the sounds of sizzling and chopping) into the podcast audio to
          make it a more relaxing and immersive experience that encourages
          listeners to tune into their senses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>We added relaxing jazz music</b> to the intro and outro to set a
          mindful mood.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>We used calming language</b> throughout with a mindful and playful
          tone that reminds audiences to rest and treat themselves with care.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Meditation sessions / breathing exercises are incorporated</b>
          throughout the longer podcasts with more of an emphasis on meditation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img src="images/meditation/prototype.png" width="60%" class="center" />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h1>Wireframes</h1>
      <p>
        We created low-fidelity wireframes for primary interfaces and produced
        sample content to emulate the intended experience. We drafted a
        preliminary prototype to further gauge the user's opinions and
        experiences. In particular, the testing comprised of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          3-minute smoothie podcast to highlight a different personality or
          comfort, in a shoerter time length
        </li>
        <li>Full version of the 10-minute tostadas podcast</li>
        <li>
          low-fidelity wireframes of offered media -- mobile, desktop, spotify,
          youtube
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

    <h1>Final Takeaways</h1>
    <p>
      During the project, I gained more insight to other college students'
      experience with meal preparation. I collaborated with my group mates,
      interviewed students, and desgined a solution to address the issue.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      One challenge was refocusing the design. When an idea did not work out the
      way it is supposed, it was difficult to come up with a new idea around the
      same topic. It is important to document your work so that you can always
      go back to see which ideas fit the purpose of the project or one can come
      up with an idea based off the direction the project is going. Our
      Cookingbuds trial did not work out the way we wanted to so we came up with
      another solution that fit the purpose of our project.
