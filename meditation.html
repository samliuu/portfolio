        Mindful Mealtime Media is a meditative cooking podcast with an emphasis
        on noticing sensations and celebrating mistakes. We planned to meet
        students' needs by providing bi-monthly grocery lists and recipes via
        text, e-mail, or physical mail service.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is a podcast that was distributed across multiple online channels
        including Spotify, Youtube, and our speical website. Listeners can find
        community, share insights, and enjoy immersive play-mode to enrich their
        mindful cooking experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        This project was created for a 14 week course, ARTG3463: Experience
        Design 2, at Northeastern University with the objective of creating
        compelling human-centered experiences.

      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>
        We kicked off our primary research by narrowing down the problem space
        that we wanted to explore and defining our goals for primary research.
        We each brainstormed ideas for questions to ask to our sample audience
        to learn more about their cooking process, cooking support, eating
        experiences, meal inspiration, ideal meal experience, grocery shopping
        experience, priorities in a meal experience, and pain points/barriers to
        enjoyable meal preparation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="margin-top: 20px">
        <b>Focus:</b> We want to make the meal preparation experience easier for
        young individuals just starting to fend for themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        <b>Actors:</b> 18-24 year olds with limited cooking experience
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        <b>Action:</b> Preparing meals - includes finding meal inspiration,
        grocery shopping, planning, cooking, nourishing your body
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        <b>Context:</b> Being new to cooking, little experience, first time
        having to cook for themselves
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />

    <h1>Cultural Probes</h1>
    <p>
      We understood that cooking is a very personal and emotional experience,
      intrinsically tied to a person's background, taste, skill-level,
      energy-level, or daily mood. In order to truly understand students'
      experiences, we thought it best to capture a snapshot into their lives by
      conducting interesting visual cultural probes. To determine which cultural
      probes would be the most impactful for gathering the type of data we
      wanted, we decided to test our methods on ourselves first.
    </p>

    <h2>Method 1: Meal Log</h2>
    <p>
      Description: Photo journal your meal prep experience for the week by
      taking candid photos of the food you eat, reflecting on the process, and
      your emotions surrounding your meals.
    </p>
    <img src="images/meditation/meal log.png" class="center" width="60%" />

    <h2>Method 2: Three Scenarios</h2>
    <p>Draw the following three meal preparation scenarios:</p>
    <ol class="meditation-ul">
      <li class="meditation-li">Typical weekday meal experience</li>
      <li class="meditation-li">Ideal weekday meal experience</li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        Ideal weekend or dream meal experience when you have all the time and
        resources you could need
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>What do you feel, think, and do in these three scenarios?</p>
    <img src="images/meditation/3 scenarios.png" class="center" width="40%" />

    <h2>Method 3: Love + Breakup Letter</h2>
    <p>
      Write a love and breakup letter to two different aspects of your meal
      preparation lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, you can choose to serenade your favorite dish or say goodbye
      to an old habit.
    </p>
    <img src="images/meditation/love-breakup letter.png" class="center" />
    <br />

    <div class="background-container">
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>Interviews</h1>
      <p>
        We conducted eight in-depth interviews and collected the three cultural
        probes with our target sample audience of college students, then
        visualized the data on personal cardsets. Below is an example of a
        personal cardset.
      </p>
      <img src="images/meditation/interview.png" width="60%" class="center" />
      <br />
    </div>

    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>Personas</h1>
    <p>
      Using our main takeaways as guidance, each member of the team brainstormed
      one persona that represents the current experience, painpoints, goals, and
      wants of our audience. Then as a team, we synthesized all our individual
      personas and condensed them into two personas that represented the three
      main problems our audience experiences:
    </p>
    <ul class="meditation-ul">
      <li>lack of cooking skills</li>
      <li>lack of inspiration</li>
      <li>lack of time</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      <img
        src="images/meditation/persona luke.png"
        width="60%"
        class="center"
      />
    </div>

    <h2>Journey Maps</h2>
    <p>
      Based on these our persona, Luke, we created a journey map to that
      reflects his motivations and painpoints, measured emotions through color
      and timeline.
    </p>
    <div>
      <img
        src="images/meditation/luke journey map.png"

    <br />

    <div class="background-container">
      <br />
      <h1>Design Proposal</h1>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        Using our personas, journey maps and user stories representing main pain
        points and wants as inspiration, we developed our design requirements to
        represent what criteria our design must meet in order to be useful for
        the audience.
      </p>

      <div id="grid" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
        <div id="left">
          <li>Quick & Easy</li>
          <li>Social Connection</li>
          <li>Low Cost</li>
          <li>Comfort & Familiarity</li>
          <li>Flexibility/Versatility</li>
        </div>
        <div id="right">
          <li>Learning Community</li>

          <li>Learning Cooking Skills</li>
          <li>Grocery Planning</li>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top: 10px">
        At this point, we had identified experiential goals and metrics, and had
        gathered enough information to understand our target audiences, we began
        to generate ideas through ideation and develop our design concept. We
        decided on our final idea by thinking about which solution solved the
        most user needs and fit the most design requirements. We decided on a
        Cooking Buddy Competition App.

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
        We created storyboards to visualize how the users would interact with
        our product.
      </p>

      <img
        src="images/meditation/storyboard 1.png"

        src="images/meditation/storyboard 2.png"
        width="55%"
        class="center"
      />
      <p>
        Our storyboard follows the journey of Luke, a college student that lives
        with his two roommates. Luke's roommates often cook food for him, which
        is his motivation to learn how to cook. While scrolling through his
        phone, he finds an app that has a cooking community, resouces, and
        recipes for various dishes. Luke gives it a try and makes his first dish
        for his roommates. A few days later, Luke gets a notification to
        participate in a weekly cooking challenge. He decides to ask his
        roommates to join this weekly cooking challenge and in the end, they all
        have fun learning a new dish and enjoying their food.
      </p>

    <h1>Cookingbuds Trial</h1>
    <p>We had some helpful and interesting takeaways after our trial:</p>

    <ul class="meditation-ul">
      <li class="meditation-li">
        <b>Not everyone followed the directions of the recipe and improvised</b>
        as they continued cooking ie. using different ingredients or
        substituting for ingredients that they didn't have.
      </li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        <b>Different prefrences:</b> Some prefered making their own salsa/guac
        instead of buying it from the store, which resulted in a longer cooking
        time.
      </li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        <b>People worked at different paces:</b> not everyone needed 10 minutes
        to cook or they needed more than 10 minutes to cook.
      </li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        <b>Background activity/noise</b> made the experience distracting and
        listening to everyone talk on the Zoom call while trying to focus on
        cooking was overstimulating.
      </li>
      <li class="meditation-li">
        <b>The video chat feature made focusing on cooking a challenge</b>
        because not everyone checks the chat.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img
      src="images/meditation/cookingbuds trial.png"
      width="60%"
      class="center"
    />
    <br />

    <div class="background-container">
      <br />
      <h1>Refocusing the Design</h1>
      <p>
        At this point, we presented our design proposal to the class. We took
        feedback from critique of our design proposal. We realized that this
        concept was not the correct solution. Building functional skills did not
        improve the cooking experience as much as we had hoped. Thus, we pivoted
        our ideas and changed our design goal to building and improving
        confidence in our audiences.
      </p>

      <h2>Problem Pivot</h2>
      <p><b>The main problem:</b></p>
      <p>
        Students' confidence in their cooking, not inspiration for cooking. For
        example, not knowing what to do, lack of confidence in skills and
        abilities, feeling intimidated by the time and skills required to cook
      </p>
      <br />

      <p><b>We refined our problem statement:</b></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        Cooking is one of many overwhelming responsibilities college students
        face and it adds to their stress. In the midst of stress, students are
        seeking a time to relax and reflect.
      </p>
      <p>
        College students often feel constrained and stressed with unpredictable
        schedules. Even meeting necessary everyday needs such as getting meals
        becomes overwhelming or mundane. In face of that stress, we believe that
        cooking could become a new source of relaxation.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p><b>Design Hypothesis:</b></p>
      <p>
        If we transform cooking into a mindful and enjoyable experience instead
        of it being a mundane responsibility, then cooking can become a mental
        therapy tool to destress college students.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b
          >Our new goal for the project was to make cooking into a comforting
          and relaxing experience in the face of stressful student life.</b
        >
        We also wanted to keep in mind that we wanted cooking to be supported
        and people can be playful with it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Experiment</h1>
    <p>
      We developed a prototype of a six-minute relaxing, mindfulness cooking
      podcast and potential Spotify interface visuals for our podcast. Then, our
      team recruited a total of 5 students (3 NEU / 2 non-NEU) to listen and
      answer some questions about our podcast to gather some feedback on if this
      design concept was successful in relaxing students.
    </p>
    <img src="images/meditation/experiment.png" class="center" width="55%" />
    <br />

    <div class="background-container">
      <br />
      <h1>Wireframing</h1>
      <p>
        In Week 12, we created low-fidelity wireframes for primary interfaces
        and produced sample content to emulate the intended experience. To
        complement our prototypes, we produced storyboards to illustrate our
        service in action.
      </p>
      <img src="images/meditation/prototype.png" width="60%" class="center" />

      <p style="margin-top: 10px">
        We drafted a preliminary prototype to further gauge the user's opinions
        and experiences. In particular, the testing comprised of:
      </p>
      <ul class="meditation-ul">
        <li class="meditation-li">
          3-minute smoothie podcast to highlight a different personality or

      <p style="margin-top: 10px">Following testing feedback:</p>
      <ul class="meditation-ul">
        <li class="meditation-li">
          <b>We incorporated environmental ASMR sounds</b>
          (like the sounds of sizzling and chopping) into the podcast audio to
          make it a more relaxing and immersive experience that encourages
          listeners to tune into their senses.
        </li>
        <li class="meditation-li">
          <b>We added relaxing jazz music</b> to the intro and outro to set a
          mindful mood.
        </li>
        <li class="meditation-li">
          <b>We used calming language</b> throughout with a mindful and playful
          tone that reminds audiences to rest and treat themselves with care.
        </li>
        <li class="meditation-li">
          <b>Meditation sessions / breathing exercises are incorporated</b>
          throughout the longer podcasts with more of an emphasis on meditation.
