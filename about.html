          I earned my degree in Computer Science and Design from Northeastern
          University May 2023. I started off my first semester as a Computer
          Science major and stumbled upon UX/UI design in my second semester.

        <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 50px">
          I enjoy designing interactions that allow others to have a fulfilling
          experience. I am passionate about learning new design techniques and
          perspective of other designers.

        <p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 50px">
          In 2022, I did a co-op at Tamr Inc. for 8 months as an associate UX
          Designer/Researcher. Currently, I'm learning HTML/CSS and I'm coding
          this portfolio as I'm learning.

      I enjoy playing games like
      <i>Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, and Zenless Zone Zero.</i> I also
      play some FPS. I enjoy co-op games like
      <i>Deep Rock Galatic, Left 4 Dead 2, R.E.P.O., and Lethal Company. </i>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">I started journaling as a kid, but picked it up after doing a project about journals during my
      senior year of high school. I've been journaling ever since. 
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">I also enjoy drawing.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">I played basketball on my high school team for 3 years. I still enjoy playing whenever I can.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Dabbled in photography in high school, mostly taking photos of landscape and food.<p>
