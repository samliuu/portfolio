    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>
      Typography 1 offers an introduction to type as a designed form and
      typographic practices that are important for formal communication. The course
      emphasizes all the basic elements and tools used in typographic hiearchy and
      page design such as sequence, navigation, legibility, graphic punctuation,
      font, weight, size, spacing, and composition.

    <h1>My Neighbor Totoro Play Book</h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of this project was to learn about book design. The
      requirements were to present text by displaying the formal aspects of
      typography and page design. I also had to explore sequencing and rhythm to
      express the narrative of the story.

    <h1>Book Plates</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
      I created 24 compositions that work together as a series while
      incorporating each of the 24 typefaces used in my logotypes. This allowed
      me to define parameters, to explore range of variation, to reinforce
      sequence and repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my first draft, I experimented with 10 colors, 3 sequences, and only
      used a black background. My bookcover used all the colors and used one
      sequence. After a couple of iterations, my final draft still used the same
      amount of colors. The changes I made were to include the typefaces in my
      logotypes and add more sequences for more variation.

    <h1>Logotype Book</h1>
    <p>
      I was introduced to 24 typefaces and I learned to recognize the difference
      between what is successful and unsuccessful in the architecture of
      character design while sharpening my technical skills. I created a mark by
      combining two letter forms from the same font family and the design of the
      mark has to show an understanding between strokes and intersections. Each
      section has background on the designer who created the type, when the
      typeface was created, and how it was used.
