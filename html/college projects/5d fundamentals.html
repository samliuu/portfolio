    <br />
    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>
      In this course, I explored the language of interactive experience as a
      compelling way communicate meaning. It also considers the factors in the
      enviornment and how they can change the way humans experience things.
      Drawing was incorporated into this course to understand the present and
      future experiences.

        For my fictional design project, I decided to focus on the values of
        delivery services -- Uber Eats, Door Dash, GrubHub, and Postmates -- and
        reflect on the kinds of values that are embedded in these services. I
        created the iCooker to engage my audience through humor and wonder.

        The iCooker is a combined burner stove top and cutting board with
        several automatic kitchen utensils and a control panel to manage the
        iCooker, which is all powered through a phone that creates electricity
        when plugged into the phone port. The iCooker is like a small mini
        kitchen that is portable and can allow users to conveniently cook
        anywhere they want. One of the main purposes of the iCooker is to get
        people off their phones and have them start focusing on their daily
        tasks, like cooking. Another purpose of the iCooker is to promote
        healthier lifestyles and diets for those who have little experience with
        cooking and those who often order take out for their meals. Also, the
        iCooker informs the user about how their meals are affecting them, for
        instance, the control panel shows the user how many calories are being
        consumed, tracks how many nutrients the user is intaking, and notifies
        the user of how much exercise is needed to burn off the meal. The only
        thing that the user needs to provide are the ingredients to a recipe.

        There are two events that inspired the creation of the iCooker: my
        college roommate and the project, ​Collaborative Cooking​, created by
        Christian Isberg, Petter Johansson, Lasse Korsgaard, and Carl Berglöf.
        My college roommate inspired the iCooker because he spends most of his
        time watching television and playing video games and he often orders
        take out because he has little to no experience with cooking. The
        ​Collaborative Cooking​ project also inspired the iCooker because it is
        a digital platform that influences and interacts with a physical cooking
        machine to explore how people will prepare and discuss food. This
        project enhances the way people interact with food, which could also be
        the case with the iCooker, since beginner cooks will potentially use
        this product. One of my goals for creating the iCooker is to keep people
        off their phones for a couple of hours a day because people are
        constantly looking at and scrolling through their phones. The phone port
        will force people to stop using their phones while they are cooking.
        Another goal is to allow people to cook with no distractions.

      <h1>Storyboard</h1>
      <p>
        The storyboard follows Arwin, who has little to no experience with
        cooking. Arwin is very hungry, but it is too late to order food. He
        attempts to cook, but ends up in himself in the process. He asks for
        advice online and goes to sleep hungry. In the morning, he stumbles upon
        a response that recommened the iCooker, an automatic burner and cutting
        board that helps people cook. Arwin immediately orders the iCooker and
        it arrives the next day. He decides to make pan fried noodles. To turn
        on the iCooker, Arwin plugs in his phone into the port and the device
        powers on. Arwin places washed vegetables on the cutting board section
        of the iCooker and a mechanical arm with a knife pops out to start
        cutting the vegetables. Then, he places a pan with water on the burner.
        The control pannel gives Arwin instructions on how to cook the noodles
        and vegetables. 10 minutes later, the meal is ready.

        This Chinese New Year Celebration event called ‘The Three Lions’ is
        located in Boston, Chinatown and it features a magenta, sky blue, and
        orange lion dance costume ceramic statues that are placed on a dark red
        platform, which is also located next to a traditional Chinese lion dance
        drum, a Chinese gong, and five boxes with lion dance costumes made out
        of plastic and fabric. The statues are made out of ceramic glass because
        it is tough, translucent, and opalescent which will bring out the bright
        colors. Traditional lion dance costumes are typically made out of wood
        and paper, which could be troublesome when children interact with it. To
        make the costumes more durable, the tail of the body is made out of
        fabric and the head of the dragon is made out of plastic and fabric.
        Traditional instruments are also used because it will give everyone the
        full experience of the whole lion dance.

        An experience that inspired this creation was going to the Chinese New
        Year festivals in Boston, Chinatown to see the powerful and mesmerizing
        lion performance as a child. I remember the vivid colors of the lion's
        costume and the lion's fluttering eyes, but the only thing I wanted to
        do was to touch and be inside of the lion's head. Since the material of
        the lion costumes was delicate, I was only able to view from afar, but
        did not have the experience of interacting with the lion costume. An
        event that inspired this creation was the seasonal event, Films at the
        Gate presented by the Asian Community Development Corporation (ACDC).
        Every summer in Boston, the Chinatown and ACDC community members create
        a free outdoor theater showing classic Chinese-language and Kung-Fu
        films on the Rose Kennedy Greenway - Chinatown Park. This seasonal event
        allowed people around the community to come together and enjoy their
        time together, which is one of my goals when I was creating this
        project. Another one of my goals was to allow children and adults to
        have the experience to interact with the lion dance costumes and learn
        how to do some of the basic dances.
