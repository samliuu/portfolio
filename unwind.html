    <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <p>

      outdoor areas around campus, and the botanical garden.

    <h1>Interviews</h1>
    <p>

      Well-being, my team and I are gathering information on the creation and
      accessibility of green spaces. We want to learn where these green spaces
      are and who has access to them. We are interested in learning about the
      green spaces that are available to students (high school and on or off
      campus college students) and how they interact with their green
      surroundings.

I can’t think of any of green spaces other than making sure there’s one every few blocks so people don’t have to go so far to go to one.
