        B:  I’m living off campus currently but I’ve lived on campus for two years (my freshmen and sophomore year). It is located in Boston MA, specifically the Roxbury neighborhood by Ruggles station from the orange line.

        B: I would usually put on my earbuds to listen to some music on my way to class. Cross some streets when it’s safe to cross. I’d cross the train tracks, and make my way to the classroom using the quickest path. When it’s spring or summer - trees! And lots of nice, colorful flowers. Some grass, and birds.
        
        How long does it take for you to walk to your local park? What do you enjoy doing when you’re free to go outside? 
        B: There’s about three parks near me. On average, all three take about 10 mins to get to. I like to go get food and walk around with my friends to places like Downtown or Boston Common.

        B: I don’t tend to visit the parks around my area bc they’re not that pretty and there’s not a lot of green area around my home. Mostly city and concrete.
        
        Opinion
        In comparison with other Boston neighborhoods would you say your neighborhoods has more or lees green spaces?
        B: Actually maybe more green spaces? Off the top of my head, there’s about 6-7 green spaces I can get to within 20 mins of walking.

        B: If we disregard quarantine, I’d say very accessible!
        
        How do you think we can improve people's ability to access parks and green spaces?
        B: If you think about it, not all park structures are tailored to people who have disabilities, like being on a wheelchair? It’d be nice to have some more inclusive parks. Like restructuring parks or adding more features to be more inclusive. I can’t think of any of green spaces other than making sure there’s one every few blocks so people don’t have to go so far to go to one.

        Where do you like to spend your time outside? How do you feel when you’re outside? What do you see when you’re outside?

        Where do you like to spend your time outside? How do you feel when you’re outside? What do you see when you’re outside? 
        C: When I do go outside, I spend most of my time around Chinatown with my friends catching up, getting boba. When I am outside, I am at my best/happiest because I am surrounded with my friends/cousins. When I am outside, I see a lot of buildings and cars since I am in the city.
