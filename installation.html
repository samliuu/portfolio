          An interactive light installation that gave students an immersive
          space for meditation and mindfulness on campus by using animated
          colors to display visual representations of emotions, with the aim of
          giving students a place of restoration and release. By introducing
          color therapy in the form of animated lights, students could exist in
          a restorative space illuminated by their manifestations of emotions.

        <br />
        <div>
          The space was constructed with LED lights diffused by cotton balls to
          create a soft and inviting glow. The lights were animated based on
          predetermined designs that involve both color and movement to convey
          the desired emotion.

    <br />
    <h1>Background</h1>

    <p>
      Our overall goal was to create an interactive light installation by the
      end of the school year with the goal of giving students an immersive space
      for meditation, mindfulness, and relaxation on campus. We conducted a
      survey with Northeastern students asking about their experiences with
      mindfulness and meditation on campus and identified a need for a space
      like this to exist and be easily accessible to students. We wanted to find
      a place where students can go to have some visual release of anything they
      struggle with, and have interactive lights and colors meet their
      therapeutic needs that they specified through entering on a website
    </p>

    <!-- -------------- Research  -------------- -->
    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
      Our research process was extremely exploratory. We kept broad guidelines
      for the idea of our project -- an interactive experience that involved
      animated lights -- but kept our minds open throughout the semester to how
      that might form. We brainstormed different ideas through class activities,
      conducted user research and competitive analysis, sketched ideas and
      worked through personas. Through this process, we discovered that we
      wanted to explore color theory and looked into how color maps and human
      emotion. With basic understanding of human emotion and color theory, we
      ultimately decided to focus our project to serve the needs of stressed
      students.

    <!-- ---------------- MVP ---------------- -->
    <h1>Defining the MVP</h1>
    <p>We identified the following key features:</p>
    <div id="grid">
      <div id="left">
        <li style="margin-left: 50px">
          A functioning, high-fidelity prototype of user interface
        </li>
        <li style="margin-left: 50px">Designed animations</li>
      </div>
      <div id="right">
        <li style="margin-left: 50px">Solidified installation space</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 50px">Fully constructed installation</li>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br />

    <p>
      After thinking through possible use cases and considering the typical
      actions and relaxation patterns of students, we decided some core
      functionality of our space:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b
          >Partnering with the Sacred Space will provide legitamcy and raise
          awareness for our installation.</b
        >
        With their help, we got funding, marketed the project, and recieved
        incremental design feedback from who worked daily with student mental
        health and restorative practices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lighten Up has a default state.</b> When no one was actively
        interacting with the installation, there was a default animation and
        light show that happened. This was very minimal and provided neutral
        emotional benefits.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lighten Up was not meant to 'cure'.</b> We wanted to market this
        space as a restorative experience, but it was not intended to heal or
        force feelings upon someone. The color animations were designed to
        reflect feelings and thoughts in order to promote ease of mind and
        distract from negative feelings.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />

    <!-- -------------- Persona & Storyboard -------------- -->
    <h1>Persona & Storyboard</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      After defining our MVP based on user research, we created personas to help
      visualize the target audience, which were college students who wanted a
      space to relax and practice mindfulness. Our persona, Lisa Grant, was
      referred to throughout the design process to remain focused when we made
      design decisions.

      This storyboard follows the journey of Lisa, who is anxious with the
      copious amount of homework. Unable to find a space to do some work and
      potentially unwind from stress, she stumbles upon a poster that advertises
      a space that promotes mindfulness and relaxation. Peaking her interest,
      Lisa decides to attend the opening of the installation. She was able to
      relieve some of her stress after interacting with the installation.

    <h2>Space Design</h2>
    <p>
      The main idea revolved around diffusing LEDs with cottonballs on poster
      boards that can be hung around the room to fill the space. We wanted to
      make a cloud-like display and show lighting within the LED. The first
      image show two conceptual models that we made that showcase the LEDS and a
      diagram that shows our vision of the installation set up. The second and
      third images were the final mockups of our installation.

      <h1 class="h1-main">Web Development</h1>
      <p>
        We created a website with React for users to interact with the
        installation. There is a home page that has a quick description of what
        the installation is about. There is a survey page and confirmation page
        for users to input their feelings and information about their manifested
        feeling. We also included a page for our color theory research for users
        who are interested. Here is the link to the website:

      <h2>Hi-fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p>
        The home screen gave the user a short overview of the purpose of
        installation. From the home screen, users could access the survey by
        pressing the <i>'Enter the restorative space>'</i> to interact with the
        LED lights. Users can also interact with the <i>'Learn more>'</i> button
        to access the color theory research page.

      <br />

      <h3>Survey Screens</h3>
      <p>
        To interact with the installation, users had to complete a quick survey
        of: their current feeling, a feeling they want to let go of, and a
        feeling they want to manifest. Depending on the user input, a color
        based off of what we researched appear in the installation. Once the
        user submitted their survey, they were directed to the confirmation
        screen and their manifested feeling would be added to the queue. The
        confirmation screen showed the user the manifested color and a preview
        of what kinds of colors they were able to see in the installation.

      <h3>Color Theory Screen</h3>
      <p>
        We displayed a color palette for different types of feelings based on
        the research we have done. There are 5 palettes that were combined and
        mapped to different feelings. These colors correlated to an animation
        that was lit up through LED lights and fiber optics in the installation.
        We also included the sources to the research so that users can look into
        color theory.

        We used Adobe After Effects to create animations that the users preview
        on the website. Here are the links to the animations:

      <h2>Poster Designs</h2>
      <p>
        The posters were created on Figma. We created 5 different sets of
        posters based on our color theory research.

    <!-- -------------- Installation Building -------------- -->
    <h1>Raspberry Pi & Arduino Setup</h1>
    <p>
      We used a Rasberry Pi to play the animations we created on the LEDs. A
      small script was written for each of the animations and we used our GitHub
      server to connect with the Raspberry Pi to play those animations when the
      user submitted a survey form. We used the Arduino software application to
      practice our LED animations. This was where we sampled our animations and
      worked through any small bugs before we began development with the actual
      equipment.

    <h1>Constructing the Installation</h1>
    <p>
      The installation was located in the Northeastern Center for Spirituality,
      Dialogue, and Service (Ell Hall 206F). We first put up a layer of
      cardboard with command strips to make sure we did not damage the walls.
      Then, we hung up LED lights and connected each strip with jumper wires.
      When all the LEDs were working, we diffused the light with cotton balls.
      We also used black construction paper to black out the windows so that the
      lights illumiated the room.

    <h1>Final Takeaways</h1>
    <p>
      During this capstone, I gained experience in learning about color therapy
      and the process of building an installation in a public place. I
      collaborated with an organization (the Center for Spirituality, Dialogue,
      and Service) and spoke to students on campus about meditation and
      mindfulness.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Some things I would add to the space would be adding some music or sounds
      for the different animations. This would make the space more immersive and
      interactive. Adding furniture such as bean bags and chairs for
      participants to feel more comfortable in the space.
