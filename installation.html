        <h3 style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px">Project Overview</h3>
        An interactive light installation that gave students an immersive space
        for meditation and mindfulness on campus by using animated colors to
        display visual representations of emotions, with the aim of giving
        students a place of restoration and release. By introducing color
        therapy in the form of animated lights, students could exist in a
        restorative space illuminated by their manifestations of emotions.
        <br />
        <br />
        The space was constructed with LED lights diffused by cotton balls to
        create a soft and inviting glow. The lights were animated based on
        predetermined designs that involve both color and movement to convey the
        desired emotion.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lighten Up took take place in an Ell Hall classroom during the last half
        of the month of March, targeting Northeastern's Wellness Week in
        collaboration with Northeastern's Sacred Space.

      <p class="p-main">
        Our overall goal was to create an interactive light installation by the
        end of the school year with the goal of giving students an immersive
        space for meditation, mindfulness, and relaxation on campus. We
        conducted a survey with Northeastern students asking about their
        experiences with mindfulness and meditation on campus and identified a
        need for a space like this to exist and be easily accessible to
        students. We wanted to find a place where students can go to have some
        visual release of anything they struggle with, and have interactive
        lights and colors meet their therapeutic needs that they specified
        through entering on a website

    <!-- -------------- Research  -------------- -->
    <h1 class="h1-main">Research</h1>
    <p class="p-main">
      Our research process was extremely exploratory. We kept broad guidelines
      for the idea of our project -- an interactive experience that involved
      animated lights -- but kept our minds open throughout the semester to how
      that might form. We brainstormed different ideas through class activities,
      conducted user research and competitive analysis, sketched ideas and
      worked through personas. Through this process, we discovered that we
      wanted to explore color theory and looked into how color maps and human
      emotion. With basic understanding of human emotion and color theory, we
      ultimately decided to focus our project to serve the needs of stressed
      students.

    <!-- ---------------- Considerations ---------------- -->
    <h1 class="h1-main">Defining the MVP</h1>
    <p class="p-main">We identified the following key features:</p>
    <div id="grid">
      <div id="left">
        <li style="margin-left: -90px">
          A functioning, high-fidelity prototype of user interface
        </li>
        <li style="margin-left: -90px">Designed animations</li>
      </div>
      <div id="right">
        <li style="margin-left: 130px">Solidified installation space</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 130px">Fully constructed installation</li>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br />

    <p class="p-main">
      After thinking through possible use cases and considering the typical
      actions and relaxation patterns of students, we decided some core
      functionality of our space:
    </p>
    <ul class="ul-main">
      <li class="li-main">
        <b
          >Partnering with the Sacred Space will provide legitamcy and raise
          awareness for our installation.</b
        >
        With their help, we got funding, marketed the project, and recieved
        incremental design feedback from who worked daily with student mental
        health and restorative practices.
      </li>
      <li class="li-main">
        <b>Lighten Up has a default state.</b> When no one was actively
        interacting with the installation, there was a default animation and
        light show that happened. This was very minimal and provided neutral
        emotional benefits.
      </li>
      <li class="li-main">
        <b>Lighten Up was not meant to 'cure'.</b> We wanted to market this
        space as a restorative experience, but it was not intended to heal or
        force feelings upon someone. The color animations were designed to
        reflect feelings and thoughts in order to promote ease of mind and
        distract from negative feelings.

        After defining our MVP based on user research, we created personas to
        help visualize the target audience, which were college students who
        wanted a space to relax and practice mindfulness. Our persona, Lisa
        Grant, was referred to throughout the design process to remain focused
        when we made design decisions.

        Our team's main idea revolved around diffusing LEDs with cottonballs on
        poster boards that can be hung around the room to fill the space. We
        wanted to make a cloud-like display and show lighting within the LED.
        The first image show two conceptual models that we made that showcase
        the LEDS and a diagram that shows our vision of the installation set up.
        The second and third images were the final mockups of our installation.

        the installation is about. There is a survey page and confirmation page
        for users to input their feelings and information about their manifested
        feeling. We also included a page for our color theory research for users

        based off of what we researched appear in the installation. Once the

        screen and their manifested feeling would be added to the queue. The

      <p class="p-main">
        The posters were created on Figma. We created 5 different sets of
        posters based on our color theory research.

    <!-- -------------- Installation Building -------------- -->
    <h2 class="h2-main">Raspberry Pi & Arduino Setup</h2>
    <p class="p-main">
      We used a Rasberry Pi to play the animations we created on the LEDs. A
      small script was written for each of the animations and we used our GitHub
      server to connect with the Raspberry Pi to play those animations when the
      user submitted a survey form. We used the Arduino software application to
      practice our LED animations. This was where we sampled our animations and
      worked through any small bugs before we began development with the actual
      equipment.

    <h2 class="h2-main">Constructing the Installation</h2>
    <p class="p-main">
      The installation was located in the Northeastern Center for Spirituality,
      Dialogue, and Service (Ell Hall 206F). We first put up a layer of
      cardboard with command strips to make sure we did not damage the walls.
      Then, we hung up LED lights and connected each strip with jumper wires.
      When all the LEDs were working, we diffused the light with cotton balls.
      We also used black construction paper to black out the windows so that the
      lights illumiated the room.
