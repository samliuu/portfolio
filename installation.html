        An interactive light installation that gave students an immersive space
        for meditation and mindfulness on campus by using animated colors to
        display visual representations of emotions, with the aim of giving
        students a place of restoration and release. By introducing color
        therapy in the form of animated lights, students could exist in a
        restorative space illuminated by their manifestations of emotions.
        <br />
        <br />
        The space was constructed with LED lights diffused by cotton balls to
        create a soft and inviting glow. The lights were animated based on
        predetermined designs that involve both color and movement to convey the
        desired emotion.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lighten Up took take place in an Ell Hall classroom during the last half
        of the month of March, targeting Northeastern's Wellness Week in
        collaboration with Northeastern's Sacred Space.

      <h1 class="h1-main">Background</h1>

      <p class="p-main">
        Our overall goal was to create an interactive light installation by the
        end of the school year with the goal of giving students an immersive
        space for meditation, mindfulness, and relaxation on campus. We
        conducted a survey with Northeastern students asking about their
        experiences with mindfulness and meditation on campus and identified a
        need for a space like this to exist and be easily accessible to
        students. We wanted to find a place where students can go to have some
        visual release of anything they struggle with, and have interactive
        lights and colors meet their therapeutic needs that they specified
        through entering on a website

    <!-- -------------- Research Overview -------------- -->
    <h1 class="h1-main">Research Overview</h1>
    <p class="p-main">
      Our research process was extremely exploratory. We kept broad guidelines
      for the idea of our project -- an interactive experience that involved
      animated lights -- but kept our minds open throughout the semester to how
      that might form.
    </p>
    <p class="p-main">
      We brainstormed different ideas through class activities, conducted user
      research and competitive analysis, sketched ideas and worked through
      personas. Each of these steps helped shaped our final product and allowed
      for us to iterate through different forms. We discovered that we wanted to
      explore color theory and looked into how color maps and human emotion.
      With basic understanding of human emotion and color theory, we ultimately
      decided to focus our project to serve the needs of stressed students.

    <figcaption> The color mapping was done by picking complementary shades within the

    <!-- ---------------- Considerations ---------------- -->
    <h1>Defining the MVP</h1>
    <p>We identified the following key features:</p>
    <ul class="installation-ul">
      <li class="installation-li">
        A functioning, high-fidelity prototype of user interface
      </li>
      <li class="installation-li">Designed animations</li>
      <li class="installation-li">Solidified installation space</li>
      <li class="installation-li">Fully constructed installation</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h2>Development Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      As we began to conceptualize our idea, there were many development
      considerations that we asked ourselves to ensure our installation would
      serve our audience.
    </p>
    <ul class="installation-ul">
      <li class="installation-li">
        What kind of sensory experience will make students relax?
      </li>
      <li class="installation-li">
        How do we make our installation accessible to everyone?
      </li>
      <li class="installation-li">
        What types of interactions will be availabe to someone entering the
        space?
      </li>
      <li class="installation-li">
        What will be the defauly experience in the space?
      </li>
      <li class="installation-li">
        Is this space intended to enforce relaxation - or rather, promote
        meditation and acceptance?
      </li>
      <li class="installation-li">
        What do we need to do be sure that this project serves our own creative
        needs?
      </li>
      <li class="installation-li">How can light animation convey emotion?</li>
      <li class="installation-li">
        What skills do we need to learn to bring this project to fruition?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h2>Development Decisions</h2>
    <p>
      After thinking through possible use cases and considering the typical
      actions and relaxation patterns of students, we decided some core
      functionality of our space:
    </p>
    <ul class="installation-ul">
      <li class="installation-li">
        <b
          >Partnering with the Sacred Space will provide legitamcy and raise
          awareness for our installation.</b
        >
        With their help, we can get funding, market the project, and recieve
        incremental design feedback from who work daily with student mental
        health and restorative practices.
      </li>
      <li class="installation-li">
        <b>Interaction with the sacred space should be easy to access.</b> We
        decided that having a mobile accessible web application would be the
        best way for students to interact with the sapce. As almost every
        student has their own phone, it will easy for them to pull their phone
        out upon entry and access the site.
      </li>
      <li class="installation-li">
        <b>Lighten Up has a default state.</b> When no one is actively
        interacting with the installation, there should be a default animation
        and light show that happens. This will be very minimal and provide
        neutral emotional benefits.
      </li>
      <li class="installation-li">
        <b>Lighten Up is not meant to 'cure'.</b> We want to market this space
        as a restorative experience, but it is not intended to heal or force
        feelings upon someone. Color therapy is rooted in mental acceptance. The
        color animations are designed to reflect feelings and thoughts in order
        to promote ease of mind and distract from negative feelings.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <!-- -------------- Persona & Storyboard -------------- -->
      <br />
      <h2>Persona & Storyboard</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our persona, Lisa Grant, represented our targed audience, which were
        college students who wanted a spaced to relax and practice mindfulness.
        This journey map reflects Lisa's goals, motivations, and frustrations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our storyboard followed the journey of Lisa, a college student, who
        often felt anxious because of the amout of assignments she has to
        complete. While looking for a space to relieve some of her anxiety, she
        saw a poster about an interactive color installation and goes to the
        space to explore. When she got there, Lisa scanned the QR code that was
        provided and completed the survey. She inputted what she was feeling at
        the moment and what kind of feelings she would like to manifest. A few
        minutes later, a color that matched the manifested feeling lighted up
        the room.

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h2>Space Design</h2>
      <p>
        Our team's main idea revolved around diffusing LEDs with cottonballs on
        poster boards that can be hung around a room to fill the space. We
        wanted to make a cloud-like display and show lighting within the LED.
        The images to the left are two conceptual models that we made that
        showcase the LEDS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The diagram to the right shows our vision of installation set up. The
        LEDs were mounted on poster boards that were adhered to the wall with
        command strips. The LEDs were also diffused with cotton balls which gave
        a more cozy and soft texture. Power strips were be lined against the
        walls to keep the chords organized and out of view.
      </p>
      <br />

      <img
        src="images/installation/concept design.png"
        width="50%"
        class="center"
        style="margin-bottom: 50px"
      />
      <br />

      <p>
        These were the final mockups of our installation. In the left mockup, we
        planned to have LEDs on the blacked out wall and on the cardboard wall.
        In the right mockup, we planned to have the windows and the wall blacked
        out. The LEDs would only be on the cardboard wall and we would also hang
        some LEDs from the celing.

      <h2>Web Development</h2>
      <p>
        We created a website with React for users to interact with the
        installation. We have 4 main screens: home page, survey screen,
        post-survey/confirmation screen, and a color theory research screen.

            The home screen gave the user a short overview of the purpose of
            installation. From the home screen, users could access the survey by
            pressing the <i>'Enter the restorative space>'</i> to interact with
            the LED lights. Users can also interact with the
            <i>'Learn more>'</i> button to access the color theory research
            page.

            To interact with the installation, users had to complete a quick

            <li>Their current feeling</li>

          <p>
            Depending on the user input, a color based off of what we researched
            appear in the installation. Once the user submitted their survey,
            they could visualize their manifested feeling.

            to an animation that was lit up through LED lights and fiber optics
            in the installation. We also included the sources to the research so

      <h2>Animations</h2>
      <p>
        We used Adobe After Effects to create animations that the users preview
        on the website. We created animations for healing, relax, joy,
        creativity, and power.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: -1px">Here are the links to the animations:</p>

    <!-- -------------- Installation Building -------------- -->
    <br />
    <h1>Installation Milestones</h1>
    <p>
      In January, we planned to apply for grand to fund our materials. We also
      planned on collaborating with the Sacred Space so find a suitable space
      for the installation. In Feburary, we wanted to prepare for the
      installation set up, gather materials, and props needed for the space.
      Mindful March AKA Wellness Week happened during March, so we spent most of
      our time constructing the installation. We prepared our final deliverables
      and documentation for the semester during April.
    </p>
    <br />

    <!-- -------------- Project Budget-------------- -->
    <br />
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px">Project Budget</h2>
    <p>
      This was our budget for the materials to build the installation. Most of
      our budget was spent on the LED strips because we needed enough strips to
      fill one wall. We also needed bags of cotton balls to cover up the LED
      strips.

    <h2>Raspberry Pi & Arduino Setup</h2>
    <p>
      The Raspberry Pi is like a small computer that can control the LEDs. We
      wrote a small script for each of the animations and we used our server to
      connect with the Raspberry Pi to play those animations when the user
      submits the survey form.
    </p>

    <p>
      We used the Arduino software application to practice our LED animations.
      This was where we sampled our animations and worked through any small bugs
      before we began development with the actual equipment.

    <h2>Constructing the Installation</h2>
    <p>
      The installation was located in the Northeastern Center for Spirituality,
      Dialogue, and Service (Ell Hall 206F). In the space, we had the LEDs on
      the wall with stuffing to dim the lights.
