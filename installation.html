        Class description: Offered the first course in a two-term capstone
        sequence. Offers students an opportunity to work in interdisciplinary
        teams to define, research, design, plan, and implement a large-scale
        interactive project. The project concept and preliminary work were
        completed in this course, and the final project was produced in ARTG
        4701.

      <!-- -------------- Project Overview -------------- -->
      <h1>Project Overview</h1>
      <p>
        An interactive light installation that gave students an immersive space
        for meditation and mindfulness on campus by using animated colors to
        display visual representations of emotions, with the aim of giving
        students a place of restoration and release. By introducing color
        therapy in the form of animated lights, students could exist in a
        restorative space illuminated by their manifestations of emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The space was constructed with LED lights diffused by cotton balls to
        create a soft and inviting glow. The lights were animated based on
        predetermined designs that involve both color and movement to convey the
        desired emotion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lighten Up took take place in an Ell Hall classroom during the last half
        of the month of March, targeting Northeastern's Wellness Week in
        collaboration with Northeastern's Sacred Space.

      <h1>Team Roles</h1>
      <p>
        As a team, we worked on constructing the actual installation, designed
        how the lights and other materials will fit within the space, and
        conducted research about color and light therapy to inform our animation
        design and development choices.

      <!-- -------------- Research Overview -------------- -->
      <h1>Research Overview</h1>
      <p>
        Our research profess was extremely exploratory. We kept broad guidelines
        for the idea of our project -- an interactive experience that involved
        animated lights -- but kept our minds open throughout the semester to
        how that might form.
      </p>
      <p>
        We brainstormed different ideas through class activities, conducted user
        research and competitive analysis, sketched ideas and worked through
        personas. Each of these steps helped shaped our final product and
        allowed for us to iterate through different forms. We discovered that we
        wanted to explore color theory and looked into how color maps and human
        emotion. With basic understanding of human emotion and color theory, we
        ultimately decided to focus our project to serve the needs of stressed
        students.
      </p>

      <!-- -------------- Persona & Storyboard -------------- -->
      <h1>Persona & Storyboard</h1>
      <p>
        Our persona, Lisa Grant, represents our targed audience, which are
        college students who want a spaced to relax and practice mindfulness.
        This journey map reflecte Lisa's goals, motivations, and frustrations.
      </p>

        width="50%"
        class="center"
        style="margin-bottom: 50px"
      />

      <p>
        Our storyboard followed the journey of Lisa, a college student, who
        often felt anxious because of the amout of assignments she has to
        complete. While looking for a space to relieve some of her anxiety, she
        saw a poster about an interactive color installation and goes to the
        space to explore. When she got there, Lisa scanned the QR code that was
        provided and completed the survey. She input her current feelings and
        what kind of feelings she would like to manifest. A few minutes later, a
        color that matches the manifested feeling lights up the room.
      </p>

      />

      <!-- -------------- Space Design-------------- -->
      <h1>Space Design</h1>
      <p>
        Our team's main idea revolves around diffusing LEDs with cottonballs on
        poster boards that can be hung around a room to fill the space. We
        wanted to make a cloud-like display and show lighting within the LED.
        The images to the left are two conceptual models that we made that
        showcase the LEDS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The diagram to the right shows our vision of installation set up. The
        LEDs were mounted on poster boards that were adhered to the wall with
        command strips. The LEDs were also diffused with cotton balls which gave
        a more cozy and soft texture. Power strips will be lined against the
        walls to keep the chords organized and out of view.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/installation/concept design.png"
        width="50%"
        class="center"
        style="margin-bottom: 50px"
      />

      <p>
        These were the final mockup of our installation. In the left mockup, we
        planned to have LEDs on the blacked out wall and on the cardboard wall.
        In the right mockup, we planned to have the windows and the wall blacked
        out. The LEDs would only be on the cardboard wall and we would also hang
        some LEDs from the celing.

      <!-- -------------- Web Development-------------- -->
      <h1>Web Development</h1>

      <p>
        We created a website with React for users to interact with the
        installation. We have 4 main screens: home page, survey screen,
        post-survey/confirmation screen, and a color theory research screen.
      </p>
      <h2>Lo-fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <img
        src="images/installation/lofi wireframes.png"
        width="50%"
        class="center"
      />

      <h2>Hi-fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        The home screen gave the user a short overview of the purpose of
        installation. From the home screen, users could access the survey by
        pressing the <i>'Enter the restorative space>'</i> to interact with the
        LED lights. Users can also interact with the <i>'Learn more>'</i> button
        to access the color theory research page.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/installation/hifi-homepage.png"
        width="20%"
        class="center"
        style="margin-bottom: 50px"
      />
      <p>
        To interact with the installation, users had to complete a quick survey
        of:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Their current feeling</li>
        <li>A feeling they want to let go of</li>
        <li>A feeling they want to manifest</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Depending on the user input, a color based off of what we researched
        appaered in the installation. Once the user submitted their survey, they
        could visualize their manifested feeling.

        This is the confirmation screen. It showed the user the manifested color
        and a preview of what kinds of colors they were able to see in the
        installation. There was an option for users to learn more about the
        color theory research in another screen.

        We displayed a color palette for different types of feelings based on
        the research we have done. There are 5 palettes that were combined and
        mapped to different feelings. These colors correlated to an animation
        that was lit up through LED lights and fiber optics in the installation.
        We also included the sources to the research so that users can look into
        color theory.

      <h1>Animations</h1>
      <p>
        We used Adobe After Effects to create animations that the users preview
        on the website. We created animations for healing, relax, joy,
        creativity, and power.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: -1px">Here are the links to the animations:</p>

      <h1>Raspberry Pi & Arduino Setup</h1>
      <p>
        The Raspberry Pi is like a small computer that can control the LEDs. We
        wrote a small script for each of the animations and we used our server to
        connect with the Raspberry Pi to play those animations when the user
        submits the survey form.
      </p>

      <p>
        We used the Arduino software application to practice our LED animations.
        This was where we sampled our animations and worked through any small
        bugs before we began development with the actual equipment.

      <div class="installation-milestones">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 50px; margin-left: 350px">January</h3>
        <p>
          Applied for grants - for our materials and collaborating with the
          Sacred Space to find a suitable space for the installation.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 50px; margin-left: 350px">Feburary</h3>
        <p>
          Prepared for the set up of the installation and gathered
          materials/props needed for the space.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 50px; margin-left: 350px">March</h3>
        <p>
          We planned to have our installation up by the 3rd week of March, which
          is Mindful March "AKA" Wellness Week.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h1>Building the Installation</h1>
      <p>
        The installation was located in the Northeastern Center for
        Spirituality, Dialogue, and Service (Ell Hall 206F). In the space, we
        had the LEDs on the wall with stuffing to dim the lights. The Raspberry
        Pi controled the light based on the user input from the website we
        created.
