        An interactive light installation that gave students an immersive space
        for meditation and mindfulness on campus by using animated colors to
        display visual representations of emotions, with the aim of giving
        students a place of restoration and release. By introducing color
        therapy in the form of animated lights, students could exist in a
        restorative space illuminated by their manifestations of emotions.
        <br />
        <br />
        The space was constructed with LED lights diffused by cotton balls to
        create a soft and inviting glow. The lights were animated based on
        predetermined designs that involve both color and movement to convey the
        desired emotion.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lighten Up took take place in an Ell Hall classroom during the last half
        of the month of March, targeting Northeastern's Wellness Week in
        collaboration with Northeastern's Sacred Space.

      <p class="p-main">
        Our overall goal was to create an interactive light installation by the
        end of the school year with the goal of giving students an immersive
        space for meditation, mindfulness, and relaxation on campus. We
        conducted a survey with Northeastern students asking about their
        experiences with mindfulness and meditation on campus and identified a
        need for a space like this to exist and be easily accessible to
        students. We wanted to find a place where students can go to have some
        visual release of anything they struggle with, and have interactive
        lights and colors meet their therapeutic needs that they specified
        through entering on a website

    <!-- -------------- Research  -------------- -->
    <h1 class="h1-main">Research</h1>
    <p class="p-main">
      Our research process was extremely exploratory. We kept broad guidelines
      for the idea of our project -- an interactive experience that involved
      animated lights -- but kept our minds open throughout the semester to how
      that might form. We brainstormed different ideas through class activities,
      conducted user research and competitive analysis, sketched ideas and
      worked through personas. Through this process, we discovered that we
      wanted to explore color theory and looked into how color maps and human
      emotion. With basic understanding of human emotion and color theory, we
      ultimately decided to focus our project to serve the needs of stressed
      students.

    <!-- ---------------- Considerations ---------------- -->
    <h1 class="h1-main">Defining the MVP</h1>
    <p class="p-main">We identified the following key features:</p>
    <ul class="ul-main">
      <li class="li-main">
        A functioning, high-fidelity prototype of user interface
      </li>
      <li class="li-main">Designed animations</li>
      <li class="li-main">Solidified installation space</li>
      <li class="li-main">Fully constructed installation</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <p class="p-main">
      After thinking through possible use cases and considering the typical
      actions and relaxation patterns of students, we decided some core
      functionality of our space:
    </p>
    <ul class="ul-main">
      <li class="li-main">
        <b
          >Partnering with the Sacred Space will provide legitamcy and raise
          awareness for our installation.</b
        >
        With their help, we got funding, marketed the project, and recieved
        incremental design feedback from who worked daily with student mental
        health and restorative practices.
      </li>
      <li class="li-main">
        <b>Lighten Up has a default state.</b> When no one was actively
        interacting with the installation, there was a default animation and
        light show that happened. This was very minimal and provided neutral
        emotional benefits.
      </li>
      <li class="li-main">
        <b>Lighten Up was not meant to 'cure'.</b> We wanted to market this
        space as a restorative experience, but it was not intended to heal or
        force feelings upon someone. The color animations were designed to
        reflect feelings and thoughts in order to promote ease of mind and
        distract from negative feelings.

        Our team's main idea revolved around diffusing LEDs with cottonballs on
        poster boards that can be hung around the room to fill the space. We
        wanted to make a cloud-like display and show lighting within the LED.
        The first image show two conceptual models that we made that showcase
        the LEDS and a diagram that shows our vision of the installation set up.
        The second and third images were the final mockups of our installation.

        for users to input their feelings and information about their manifested
        feeling. We also included a page for our color theory research for users

      <p class="p-main">
        To interact with the installation, users had to complete a quick survey
        of: their current feeling, a feeling they want to let go of, and a
        feeling they want to manifest. Depending on the user input, a color
        based off of what we researched appear in the installation. Once the
        user submitted their survey, they were directed to the confirmation
        screen and their manifested feeling would be added to the queue. The
        confirmation screen showed the user the manifested color and a preview
        of what kinds of colors they were able to see in the installation.

        We displayed a color palette for different types of feelings based on

        that was lit up through LED lights and fiber optics in the installation.
        We also included the sources to the research so that users can look into
        color theory.

    <h2 class="h2-main">Raspberry Pi & Arduino Setup</h2>
    <p class="p-main">
      The Raspberry Pi is similar to a small computer that can control the LEDs.
      We wrote a small script for each of the animations and we used our server
      to connect with the Raspberry Pi to play those animations when the user
      submitted the survey form. We used the Arduino software application to
      practice our LED animations. This was where we sampled our animations and
      worked through any small bugs before we began development with the actual
      equipment.

    <h2 class="h2-main">Constructing the Installation</h2>
    <p class="p-main">
      The installation was located in the Northeastern Center for Spirituality,
      Dialogue, and Service (Ell Hall 206F). In the space, we had the LEDs on
      the wall with stuffing to dim the lights.
