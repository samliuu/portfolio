      Class description: Offered the first course in a two-term capstone
      sequence. Offers students an opportunity to work in interdisciplinary
      teams to define, research, design, plan, and implement a large-scale
      interactive project. The project concept and preliminary work were
      completed in this course, and the final project was produced in ARTG 4701.

        An interactive light installation that gave students an immersive space
        for meditation and mindfulness on campus by using animated colors to
        display visual representations of emotions, with the aim of giving
        students a place of restoration and release. By introducing color
        therapy in the form of animated lights, students could exist in a
        restorative space illuminated by their manifestations of emotions.
        <br />
        <br />
        The space was constructed with LED lights diffused by cotton balls to
        create a soft and inviting glow. The lights were animated based on
        predetermined designs that involve both color and movement to convey the
        desired emotion.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lighten Up took take place in an Ell Hall classroom during the last half
        of the month of March, targeting Northeastern's Wellness Week in
        collaboration with Northeastern's Sacred Space.

    <!-- -------------- Research Overview -------------- -->
    <h1>Research Overview</h1>
    <p>
      Our research profess was extremely exploratory. We kept broad guidelines
      for the idea of our project -- an interactive experience that involved
      animated lights -- but kept our minds open throughout the semester to how
      that might form.
    </p>
    <p>
      We brainstormed different ideas through class activities, conducted user
      research and competitive analysis, sketched ideas and worked through
      personas. Each of these steps helped shaped our final product and allowed
      for us to iterate through different forms. We discovered that we wanted to
      explore color theory and looked into how color maps and human emotion.
      With basic understanding of human emotion and color theory, we ultimately
      decided to focus our project to serve the needs of stressed students.
    </p>

    <!-- -------------- Persona & Storyboard -------------- -->
    <h1>Persona & Storyboard</h1>
    <p>
      Our persona, Lisa Grant, represents our targed audience, which are college
      students who want a spaced to relax and practice mindfulness. This journey
      map reflecte Lisa's goals, motivations, and frustrations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our storyboard followed the journey of Lisa, a college student, who often
      felt anxious because of the amout of assignments she has to complete.
      While looking for a space to relieve some of her anxiety, she saw a poster
      about an interactive color installation and goes to the space to explore.
      When she got there, Lisa scanned the QR code that was provided and
      completed the survey. She input her current feelings and what kind of
      feelings she would like to manifest. A few minutes later, a color that
      matches the manifested feeling lights up the room.

    <!-- -------------- Space Design-------------- -->
    <h1>Space Design</h1>
    <p>
      Our team's main idea revolves around diffusing LEDs with cottonballs on
      poster boards that can be hung around a room to fill the space. We wanted
      to make a cloud-like display and show lighting within the LED. The images
      to the left are two conceptual models that we made that showcase the LEDS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diagram to the right shows our vision of installation set up. The LEDs
      were mounted on poster boards that were adhered to the wall with command
      strips. The LEDs were also diffused with cotton balls which gave a more
      cozy and soft texture. Power strips will be lined against the walls to
      keep the chords organized and out of view.
    </p>
    <div id="grad1">

        class="center"
        style="margin-bottom: 50px"
      />
      <br />
    </div>

    <p>
      These were the final mockup of our installation. In the left mockup, we
      planned to have LEDs on the blacked out wall and on the cardboard wall. In
      the right mockup, we planned to have the windows and the wall blacked out.
      The LEDs would only be on the cardboard wall and we would also hang some
      LEDs from the celing.

            Depending on the user input, a color based off of what we researched
            appaered in the installation. Once the user submitted their survey,
            they could visualize their manifested feeling.

            This is the confirmation screen. It showed the user the manifested
            color and a preview of what kinds of colors they were able to see in
            the installation. There was an option for users to learn more about
            the color theory research in another screen.

            We displayed a color palette for different types of feelings based
            on the research we have done. There are 5 palettes that were
            combined and mapped to different feelings. These colors correlated
            to an animation that was lit up through LED lights and fiber optics
            in the installation. We also included the sources to the research so
            that users can look into color theory.

    <h1>Animations</h1>
    <p>
      We used Adobe After Effects to create animations that the users preview on
      the website. We created animations for healing, relax, joy, creativity,
      and power.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: -1px">Here are the links to the animations:</p>

    <h1>Raspberry Pi & Arduino Setup</h1>
    <p>
      The Raspberry Pi is like a small computer that can control the LEDs. We
      wrote a small script for each of the animations and we used our server to
      connect with the Raspberry Pi to play those animations when the user
      submits the survey form.
    </p>

    <p>
      We used the Arduino software application to practice our LED animations.
      This was where we sampled our animations and worked through any small bugs
      before we began development with the actual equipment.

    <h1>Building the Installation</h1>
    <p>
      The installation was located in the Northeastern Center for Spirituality,
      Dialogue, and Service (Ell Hall 206F). In the space, we had the LEDs on
      the wall with stuffing to dim the lights.
    </p>

    <p>
      We planned to have our installation up by the 3rd week of March, which is
      Mindful March "AKA" Wellness Week.
